XTerm/urxvt/st, Oh-my-Zsh, Vim

## Work-in-progress

This repo contains all my currently used configuration files, however I am
working on writing an install script to fetch all the required packages I use
on a daily basis, including the following:

* Visual Studio Code
* XTerm / urxvt / st (I still haven't decided which one to use daily)
* Rust (Rustup, Cargo, RLS, etc.)
* ZSH and Oh-my-Zsh
* Nextcloud Client
* and more

At the moment, it does not copy the configuration files into the right place, so that will need to be done manually.
